# Session Log - 2025-01-18

## Actions Taken
1. Attempted to restore static-pages directory from remote repository.
2. Checked for stashed changes and found modifications to the static page generator.
3. Verified the .gitignore file to confirm static-pages was not ignored.
4. Ran `git clean` which removed untracked files, including static-pages.
5. Ran `generate-dynamic-home.js` to regenerate the home page.
6. Started the server to view the generated page.

## Results
- The static-pages directory was not restored from the remote or stash.
- Running `generate-dynamic-home.js` successfully generated a new home.html file.
- The server started successfully, but the home page was truncated.

## Understanding the Results
- The static-pages directory was lost due to `git clean` removing untracked files.
- The home page generation script relies on cached stories and template.html.

## Next Steps
- Rebuild the home page generation and display system step-by-step.
- Create detailed logs for each step to capture important knowledge.

## Lessons Learned
- Be cautious with destructive operations like `git clean`.
- Ensure important files are tracked or backed up before performing such operations.
- Detailed logging can help preserve knowledge and facilitate future recovery efforts.
