## Bug Fix: Home Page Content Duplication

### Issue Description
The home page was displaying duplicate content, specifically showing the Featured section content in other category sections (Roadside Attractions, Nature, Play).

### Root Cause
1. Duplicate variable declarations in `generate-dynamic-home.js`:
   - `$featuredSection` was declared twice
   - `categories` was declared twice
2. These duplicate declarations were causing the script to crash before properly processing category sections

### Solution
1. Fixed variable naming conflicts:
   - Renamed second `$featuredSection` to `$featuredContentSection`
   - Removed duplicate `categories` declaration by inlining the array in the for...of loop
2. These fixes allowed the script to:
   - Properly mark featured stories as "used"
   - Filter out used stories before processing each category
   - Select unique stories for each category section

### Verification
- Each section now displays unique content based on its category tags
- Logs confirm different stories are being selected for each section
- Featured section and category sections are properly populated with distinct content

### Code Changes
Modified `generate-dynamic-home.js`:
```javascript
// Before: Duplicate variable declaration
const $featuredSection = $('.content-section').first();
// After: Renamed to avoid conflict
const $featuredContentSection = $('.content-section').first();

// Before: Separate categories declaration
const categories = ['Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', 'Play'];
for (const category of categories) {
// After: Inline array in loop
for (const category of ['Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', 'Play']) {
```

### Results
- Home page now correctly displays different stories in each section
- Featured section maintains its unique content
- Category sections (Roadside Attractions, Nature, Play) show content specific to their tags

### Next Steps
- Monitor the home page to ensure content continues to be properly categorized
- Consider adding more logging to track story selection and filtering process
- Consider adding automated tests to catch similar issues in the future
