# Session Log - 1/18/2025, 7:49:40 AM

## Actions Taken
- Created a new folder `dynamic-pages-v02` for dynamic pages.
- Developed a script to fetch image, text, and link information from the Webflow CMS.
- Updated `generateDynamicHome` to include logic for generating sections for 'Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', and 'Play'.
- Ensured dynamically generated content is wrapped within the `pagewrapper` div.
- Restarted the server to apply changes.

## Results
- Successfully created a dynamic home page with multiple sections based on data from the Webflow CMS.
- Ensured the styling is consistent with the static version.

## Understanding the Results
- The dynamic page now mirrors the static version in structure and content, with styling adjustments made to ensure consistency.

## Lessons Learned
- Wrapping content within the correct HTML structure is crucial for maintaining consistent styling.

## Home Page Generation Process
1. **Environment and Setup**: The script `generateDynamicHome` is responsible for generating the home page, determining the output path based on the environment.
2. **Template Loading**: Loads the HTML template using `cheerio` for DOM manipulation.
3. **Data Fetching**: Fetches stories from the Webflow CMS using the `fetchStories` function.
4. **Category Sections**: Defines categories ('Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', 'Play') and generates sections for each.
5. **Featured Story Handling**: Identifies and uses a featured story to populate the landing cover and mobile section.
6. **DOM Manipulation**: Updates template elements with data from the featured story.
7. **Output**: Writes the modified HTML to the specified output path, creating the dynamic home page.

## Data Fetching Process
1. **Cache Check**: Attempts to read stories from a cache file (`stories.json`) and uses it if valid and less than an hour old.
2. **Fetching Fresh Data**: Fetches fresh stories from Webflow CMS using the Webflow API if the cache is invalid.
3. **Response Handling**: Validates the API response to ensure it contains a valid array of items.
4. **Data Validation and Normalization**: Ensures each story has `fieldData` or normalizes `fields` to `fieldData`.
5. **Caching**: Caches the fetched stories for future use, logging any caching errors without failing the process.

## File Documentation
- **dynamic-pages-v02**: A new folder created to store dynamically generated pages.
- **fetch-webflow-data.js**: A script to fetch image, text, and link information from the Webflow CMS. Usage: Run the script using `node fetch-webflow-data.js` to retrieve and log data.
- **generate-dynamic-home.js**: Contains the logic for generating the dynamic home page, including fetching stories and generating sections for different categories. Usage: Integrated into the server to dynamically generate the home page on request.
- **server.js**: Updated to serve static files from `dynamic-pages-v02` and generate the home page there. Usage: Run the server using `node server.js` or `sh restart-server.sh` to apply changes and serve the dynamic content.

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the dynamic content generation process and explore additional features or improvements.
