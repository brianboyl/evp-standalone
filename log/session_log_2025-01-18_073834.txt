## Actions Taken
1. Created a new folder `dynamic-pages-v02` for dynamic pages.
2. Developed a script to fetch image, text, and link information from the Webflow CMS.
3. Updated `generateDynamicHome` to include logic for generating sections for 'Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', and 'Play'.
4. Ensured dynamically generated content is wrapped within the `pagewrapper` div.
5. Implemented content filtering for category sections using the `filterStoriesByCategory` function to ensure that stories have the appropriate tags for their respective categories.
6. Restarted the server to apply changes.

## File Documentation
- **dynamic-pages-v02**: A new folder created to store dynamically generated pages.
- **fetch-webflow-data.js**: A script to fetch image, text, and link information from the Webflow CMS. Usage: Run the script using `node fetch-webflow-data.js` to retrieve and log data.
- **generate-dynamic-home.js**: Contains the logic for generating the dynamic home page, including fetching stories and generating sections for different categories. Usage: Integrated into the server to dynamically generate the home page on request.
- **server.js**: Updated to serve static files from `dynamic-pages-v02` and generate the home page there. Usage: Run the server using `node server.js` or `sh restart-server.sh` to apply changes and serve the dynamic content.

## Field Name Mapping Process
- The `extractContent` function in `fetch-webflow-data.js` handles the translation of human-readable field names to actual database field names.
- Data is fetched using the `fetchCollectionItems` function from the Webflow CMS.
- The function maps fields such as `main-photo`, `big-thumbnail`, `main-title`, `photographer`, `subtitle`, `author`, `content-summary`, and `slug` to their respective database fields.
- This ensures that the correct data is retrieved and used in the application.

## Results
- Successfully created a dynamic home page with multiple sections based on data from the Webflow CMS.
- Ensured the styling is consistent with the static version.

## Understanding the Results
- The dynamic page now mirrors the static version in structure and content, with styling adjustments made to ensure consistency.

## Lessons Learned
- Wrapping content within the correct HTML structure is crucial for maintaining consistent styling.

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the dynamic content generation process and explore additional features or improvements.
