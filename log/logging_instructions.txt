# Logging Instructions

When requested to "log our commit," follow these instructions:

1. **Log Actions Taken**: Document what we did in the session since the last commit.
2. **Log Results**: Describe the results of those actions.
3. **Understanding the Results**: Explain how those results work.
4. **Next Steps**: Outline what needs to be done to make those results work.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Capture what we learned throughout that stage.
6. **File Documentation**: List any files generated, describe what they do, and how to use them.
7. **Timestamp and Save**: Timestamp the log and place it into the `log` folder.
8. **Insert Commit ID**: After committing changes, insert the commit ID at the top of the log file to associate it with the specific commit.

The goal of the log is to provide a future session with enough information that important knowledge is not lost.
