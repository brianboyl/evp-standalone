## Actions Taken
1. Fixed the featured item display by ensuring pagination was working correctly in `fetch-webflow-data.js`
2. Cleaned up unnecessary logging in `server.js`
3. Verified that the correct featured item (Starved Rock State Park) is being displayed

## Results
- Successfully displaying the intended featured item on the home page
- Pagination is working correctly, allowing access to all items beyond the first 100
- Server code is clean and contains only essential logging

## Understanding the Results
- The pagination implementation in `fetch-webflow-data.js` ensures we can access all items in the Webflow CMS
- The featured item is correctly identified and displayed, indicating proper handling of the 'featured' field
- Cache-control headers are properly set to prevent stale content

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring the featured item display to ensure it remains consistent
- Consider any additional features or improvements needed for the dynamic home page

## Lessons Learned
- Pagination is crucial when working with large collections in the Webflow CMS
- Keep logging focused and minimal unless actively debugging an issue
- Using `restart-server.sh` is the preferred way to restart the server during development
