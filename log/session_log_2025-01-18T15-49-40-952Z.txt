## Actions Taken
- Created a new folder `dynamic-pages-v02` for dynamic pages.
- Developed a script to fetch image, text, and link information from the Webflow CMS.
- Updated `generateDynamicHome` to include logic for generating sections for 'Roadside Attractions', 'Nature', and 'Play'.
- Ensured dynamically generated content is wrapped within the `pagewrapper` div.
- Restarted the server to apply changes.

## Results
- Successfully created a dynamic home page with multiple sections based on data from the Webflow CMS.
- Ensured the styling is consistent with the static version.

## Understanding the Results
- The dynamic page now mirrors the static version in structure and content, with styling adjustments made to ensure consistency.

## Lessons Learned
- Wrapping content within the correct HTML structure is crucial for maintaining consistent styling.
